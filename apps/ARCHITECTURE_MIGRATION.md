- **Dependencies**: MySQL, Nacos

### Refined Services

#### Auth Service (Replaces User Service)
- **Focused Responsibility**: Pure authentication and authorization
- **Enhanced Features**: JWT token management, Redis session storage
- **Improved Security**: Dedicated security configuration

#### File Upload/Download Service (Replaces File Service)
- **Specialized Function**: Core file operations with advanced features
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Chunked uploads, image processing, quota management
- **Better Performance**: Optimized for file handling operations

## Infrastructure Changes

### Added Components

#### RabbitMQ Message Queue
- **Purpose**: Asynchronous message processing for mail service
- **Configuration**: Management interface on port 15672
- **Integration**: Mail service producer/consumer pattern

### Updated Port Assignments

| Service | Port | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| Frontend | 3000 | HTTP | User Interface |
| Gateway | 8080 | HTTP | API Gateway |
| Auth Service | 8081 | HTTP | Authentication |
| File Upload/Download | 8082 | HTTP | File Operations |
| Admin Service | 8083 | HTTP | Administration |
| Membership Service | 8084 | HTTP | Subscriptions |
| File Management | 8085 | HTTP | File Metadata |
| File Recycle | 8086 | HTTP | File Recovery |
| Mail Service | 8087 | HTTP | Email Service |
| Nacos | 8848 | HTTP | Service Registry |
| MySQL | 3307 | TCP | Database |
| Redis | 6379 | TCP | Cache |
| RabbitMQ | 5672/15672 | AMQP/HTTP | Message Queue |

## Docker Compose Updates

### docker-compose.microservices.yml
- **Replaced**: user-service â†’ auth-service
- **Replaced**: file-service â†’ fileupdown-service
- **Added**: file-manage-service (8085)
- **Added**: file-recycle-service (8086)
- **Added**: mail-service (8087)
- **Added**: RabbitMQ infrastructure service

### docker-compose.minimal.yml
- **Core Services**: Gateway, Auth, File Upload/Download, Frontend
- **Infrastructure**: MySQL, Redis, Nacos
- **Purpose**: Minimal development environment with essential services

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Better Separation of Concerns
- **Authentication**: Dedicated auth-service for security
- **File Operations**: Specialized services for different file operations
- **Communication**: Async messaging for notifications

### 2. Improved Scalability
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale based on load
- **Resource Optimization**: Services can be deployed with appropriate resources
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect others

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused purpose
- **Technology Selection**: Services can use optimal tech stacks
- **Team Organization**: Teams can own specific services

### 4. Better Performance
- **Specialized Optimization**: Each service optimized for its use case
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis used effectively across services
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for email and notifications

## Development Workflow Changes

### Service Dependencies
1. **Infrastructure**: MySQL, Redis, Nacos, RabbitMQ
2. **Core**: Gateway, Auth Service
3. **File Operations**: FileUpDown Service, File Management, File Recycle
4. **Business**: Membership Service, Admin Service
5. **Communication**: Mail Service
6. **Frontend**: Vue 3 Application

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each service tested independently
- **Integration Testing**: Service-to-service communication
- **End-to-End**: Full workflow through gateway
- **Performance Testing**: File upload/download optimization

## Migration Checklist

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Architecture documentation updated
- [x] Docker Compose files updated with actual services
- [x] Port assignments finalized
- [x] Service dependencies mapped
- [x] Infrastructure requirements documented

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- [ ] Create Dockerfile templates for new services
- [ ] Update gateway routing configuration
- [ ] Create service-specific configuration files
- [ ] Implement health checks for all services
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create integration tests for service communication

## Best Practices Established

### 1. Service Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns one business domain
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent patterns
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across services

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Consistent configuration approach
- **Nacos Integration**: Dynamic configuration updates
- **Security**: No secrets in configuration files

### 3. Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: RabbitMQ for notifications and background tasks
- **Service Discovery**: Nacos for dynamic service location

### 4. Data Management
- **Database**: Each service manages its data domain
- **Caching**: Redis for shared session and temporary data
- **Consistency**: Event-driven updates across services

This migration provides a more robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture that better reflects the actual requirements and implementation of the CloudDrive platform.
